       "Officers of Chinese intelligence services continued to develop contacts with Czech political representatives throughout the entire political scene in 2022. At the same time, China has been involving members of the Chinese diaspora with growing intensity in promoting Chinese interests and gathering information, making the diaspora one of the tools of influence operations. The aim of intelligence officers and party officials is mainly to influence public opinion in order to promote a positive image of China. They also make use of previously established collaboration with certain entities in the Czech media sector. \n",

       "China continued its efforts to counter activities linked to issues known as the Five Poisons, most importantly Taiwan and Tibet, which hold a crucial position in the political agenda of the Communist party of China and are intrinsically linked to the One-China policy. China strongly objected to any collaboration with Taiwan and repeatedly issued government \n",
       "\n",
       "statements in order to draw attention to violations of so-called red lines. The BIS views such statements as an attempt to discourage any further reinforcement of the relations between Czechia and Taiwan. \n",
       "\n",
       "Regarding the Chinese diaspora, the BIS also detected the activity of so-called overseas police station employed by the Chinese regime to spy on representatives of Chinese communities in foreign countries. The stations are the long arm of the Chinese regime in relation to Chinese expatriates and in extreme cases, they can be involved in forced repatriations. The activities of Chinese overseas police stations in Czechia, however, have not yet been linked to any illegal aspects or security concerns. \n",

       "exploited for intelligence and propaganda objectives. Particularly concerning are visits by Czech scientists to China, where even without being aware of it, they can be recruited by intelligence services which often prefer to establish contact with their sources on Chinese soil. There is also a risk in the use of Chinese technology by entities of strategic importance, especially by those involved with critical infrastructure. \n",
       "\n",
       "Furthermore, China represents a threat to Czechia in terms of trade in sensitive goods including EDT (emerging and disruptive technologies), know-how transfer and reverse engineering. In 2022, China showed again an interest in companies, goods and know- how which could facilitate its technological research or enhance its research capacities. These objectives are in fact followed by China's policies such as Civil-Military Fusion, Made in China 2025 and China Standard 2035. The BIS's attention was drawn primarily to efforts to acquire producers of aeronautical equipment or electron microscopes, which can be used for the production of microchips. \n",

The attackers then took advantage of some of these institutions in an attempt to impersonate their employees and representatives."
